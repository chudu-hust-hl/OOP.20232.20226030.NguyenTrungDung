- After running the testing code for toString method, the console print out the address of that object within the pakage where the object belong to
1. Advantages of Polymorphism:
- Flexibility: Allows code to work with objects of different types through a common interface.
- Code Reusability: Promotes reuse of code across classes implementing the same interface or inheriting from the same superclass.
- Simplicity: Simplifies code maintenance and enhances readability by promoting modular design.
- Extensibility: Facilitates easy addition of new classes without modifying existing code.
2. How Inheritance Achieves Polymorphism in Java:
- Inheritance: Subclass inherits attributes and behaviors from its superclass.
- Method Overriding: Subclass can override methods inherited from its superclass, providing its own implementation.
- Runtime Polymorphism: Method implementation is determined dynamically at runtime based on the actual object type.
3. Differences Between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java:
- Concept: Inheritance establishes hierarchical relationships, while polymorphism enables objects to take multiple forms.
- Purpose: Inheritance facilitates code reuse and "is-a" relationships, while polymorphism focuses on providing a unified interface and dynamic method invocation.
- Mechanism: Inheritance is compile-time, while polymorphism is runtime.
Syntax: Inheritance is expressed using extends, while polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and overloading.
